```
Scenario 1: Search for an Element Present in the Array

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can successfully find and return the index of an element that exists in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an array with known integer elements and define a query that matches one of the elements.
  Act: Call the jumpSearch function with the array and the query element.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned value is the correct index of the query element in the array.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected result should be the index of the query element. This is crucial to validate that the search logic correctly identifies the target element.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures basic functionality for valid inputs, impacting end-user experience when a user searches for existing data.

Scenario 2: Search for an Element Not Present in the Array

Details:
  Description: Test the function’s ability to return -1 when the search query is not found in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an array with integers and a query integer that is not in the array.
  Act: Pass the array and the non-existent query to the jumpSearch function.
  Assert: Validate that the function returns -1, indicating that the element is not found.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Returning -1 when an element is not found is a convention to indicate absence. This prevents undefined behavior and misinterpretation.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test ensures the application can reliably communicate when a search operation does not yield results.

Scenario 3: Search in an Empty Array

Details:
  Description: Check the function’s handling of an empty array input and ensure it returns -1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty array and any query integer.
  Act: Execute the jumpSearch function with the empty array.
  Assert: Confirm that the output is -1, representing a failed search due to no elements.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An empty array contains no elements to find, and return -1 is expected. This prevents any logic that depends on the assumption that an index will be found.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Validates that the function gracefully handles edge cases, maintaining robustness.

Scenario 4: Search for First Element in the Array

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the search for the first element in the array is properly resolved with the correct index.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a small array where the first element is the query.
  Act: Use jumpSearch, passing the array and the query.
  Assert: Verify that the returned index is 0, the position of the first element.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The first element should be directly located at index 0. It's a straightforward test to ensure initial edge conditions are not causing errors.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures search operations can locate starting points of datasets, fundamental for functionality.

Scenario 5: Search for Last Element in the Array

Details:
  Description: Confirm the function can identify the last element in an array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an array where the last element is the sought query.
  Act: Invoke the jumpSearch with the array and the last element.
  Assert: Check the return value is the last index of the array.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Identifying elements at any position ensures all positions are checked, especially end-of-array where mistakes like out-of-bounds access might occur.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies complete array scanning, crucial for exhaustive searches.

Scenario 6: Search in an Array with Duplicate Elements

Details:
  Description: Check if the function can locate the first occurrence of a duplicate element correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Compose an array with repeated values and select a duplicate for the query.
  Act: Run jumpSearch using the array and the chosen duplicate.
  Assert: Confirm that the index of the first occurrence of the duplicate is returned.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Returning only the first occurrence aligns with the standard behavior of search functions, avoiding expensive checks for multiplicity.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures predictable behavior with arrays that may have redundancy in data, common in real-world datasets.
