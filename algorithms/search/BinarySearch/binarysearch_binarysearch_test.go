Scenario 1: Standard Case - Query Found in Middle

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies the index of a query that matches the middle element of a sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an odd-length array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and a query `3` which is the middle element.
  Act: Call `binarySearch` with this array and query.
  Assert: Verify that the returned index is `2`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks basic functionality of the binary search where the query is the middle element, ensuring core logic is working. This is crucial for confirming accurate search results in ordered datasets.

Scenario 2: Query Not Found - Less Than Minimum

Details:
  Description: Verify how the function handles a query that is less than all elements in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and query `5`.
  Act: Execute `binarySearch` with these inputs.
  Assert: Ensure the return value is `-1`, indicating "not found".
Validation:
  The assertion captures the expected outcome when searching below the array's lower boundary, testing the robustness in out-of-scope conditions.

Scenario 3: Query Not Found - Greater Than Maximum

Details:
  Description: Ensure correct behavior for a query greater than any element in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and query `60`.
  Act: Invoke `binarySearch` with this setup.
  Assert: Validate the result is `-1`.
Validation:
  This secures handling of inputs above the upper boundary, confirming the search breaks appropriately when elements exceed range.

Scenario 4: Edge Case - Single Element Match

Details:
  Description: Test the function with the simplest non-empty array where the query matches the sole element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array `[10]` and query `10`.
  Act: Run `binarySearch` with these parameters.
  Assert: Confirm the result is `0`, the index of the element.
Validation:
  Critical for verifying correct index return with minimal data, addressing small scale, matching scenarios.

Scenario 5: Edge Case - Single Element No Match

Details:
  Description: Validate handling of a single-element mismatch.
Execution:
  Arrange: Array is `[10]` and the query is `5`.
  Act: Execute `binarySearch`.
  Assert: Expect `-1` as the function result.
Validation:
  Assures that the function returns not found correctly when searching a single-element list with a non-existent number.

Scenario 6: Empty Array

Details:
  Description: Confirm how the algorithm processes an empty input array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty array `[]` and any query `10`.
  Act: Call `binarySearch`.
  Assert: Check for `-1` return indicating empty input handling.
Validation:
  Reinforces correct unavailability results and resilience with zero data parameters.

Scenario 7: All Elements Identical with Match

Details:
  Description: Test behavior in an array where all elements match the query.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array `[7, 7, 7, 7]` and a query `7`.
  Act: Call `binarySearch`.
  Assert: Verify the output can be any valid index within the array.
Validation:
  Checks function performance with uniform data; necessary for consistency in standardized data sets.

Scenario 8: All Elements Identical with No Match

Details:
  Description: Test an all-same-value array with a non-matching query.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array `[10, 10, 10, 10]` with a query `5`.
  Act: Use `binarySearch`.
  Assert: Ensure `-1` is returned.
Validation:
  Evaluates coverage and adaptability to arrays of identical elements when querying unmatched numbers.

Scenario 9: Query at Beginning of Array

Details:
  Description: Determine if the function finds the query as the first element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Array `[3, 8, 15, 20]` and query `3`.
  Act: Run `binarySearch`.
  Assert: Confirm index `0`.
Validation:
  Critical to verify beginning edge search, confirming coverage of end cases in a list.

Scenario 10: Query at End of Array

Details:
  Description: Assure discovery of a query as the last element in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Array `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` and query `10`.
  Act: Call `binarySearch`.
  Assert: Validate output is `4`.
Validation:
  Ensures the function performs as expected in searching the last indexed element.

These scenarios cover a range of normal operation and edge cases intended to ensure the `binarySearch` function accurately fulfills its intended operations and handles different boundary conditions effectively.
