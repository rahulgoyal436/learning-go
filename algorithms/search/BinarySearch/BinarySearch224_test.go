Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/search/BinarySearch/binarysearch_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestBinarySearch]

Scenario 1: Binary Search with Query Present in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check that the binarySearch function correctly returns the index of a query item if it is present in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an array of integers and a query item that is known to be in the array.
  Act: Call the binarySearch function with the prepared array and query item.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the returned index correctly corresponds to the position of the query item in the array.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion verifies that the binarySearch function correctly locates the query item within the array. This is crucial for the function's basic operation and ensures it can be used for reliable search operations.

Scenario 2: Binary Search with Query Not Present in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check that the binarySearch function correctly returns -1 when the query item is not present in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an array of integers and a query item that is known not to be in the array.
  Act: Call the binarySearch function with the prepared array and query item.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the returned index is -1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion verifies that the binarySearch function correctly handles cases where the query item is not found. This is important for error handling and ensures that the function can be used safely even with unexpected inputs.

Scenario 3: Binary Search with Empty Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check that the binarySearch function correctly returns -1 when given an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty array and any query item.
  Act: Call the binarySearch function with the prepared array and query item.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the returned index is -1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion verifies that the binarySearch function correctly handles edge cases where the array is empty. This is important for ensuring robustness and preventing crashes or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Binary Search with Multiple Occurrences of Query in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check that the binarySearch function returns the index of the first occurrence of the query item when there are multiple occurrences in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an array of integers with multiple occurrences of a particular query item.
  Act: Call the binarySearch function with the prepared array and query item.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the returned index correctly corresponds to the position of the first occurrence of the query item in the array.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion confirms that the binarySearch function can handle cases with multiple matching items. This is important for ensuring accurate and consistent results.
