Scenario 1: Query Item Exists at the Middle of the Array

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item exists exactly at the middle of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that exists exactly at the middle of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Compare the returned index with the known index of the query item in the array.
Validation:
    The expected result is the index of the query item in the array. The importance of this test is to ensure that the binarySearch function can accurately locate an item that exists in the middle of the array.

Scenario 2: Query Item Exists at the Start of the Array 

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item exists at the start of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that exists at the start of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Compare the returned index with the known index of the query item in the array.
Validation:
    The expected result is the index of the query item in the array. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function can accurately locate an item that exists at the start of the array.

Scenario 3: Query Item Exists at the End of the Array 

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item exists at the end of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that exists at the end of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Compare the returned index with the known index of the query item in the array.
Validation:
    The expected result is the index of the query item in the array. This test is crucial to ensure that the binarySearch function can accurately locate an item that exists at the end of the array.

Scenario 4: Query Item Does Not Exist in the Array 

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item does not exist in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that does not exist in the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Compare the returned index with -1, as the query item does not exist in the array.
Validation:
    The expected result is -1, indicating that the query item does not exist in the array. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function can accurately return -1 when the query item does not exist in the array.

Scenario 5: Empty Array

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the input array is empty.
Execution:
    Arrange: An empty array and any query item.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the empty array and query item.
    Assert: Compare the returned index with -1, as the array is empty.
Validation:
    The expected result is -1, indicating that the array is empty. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function can accurately return -1 when the array is empty.
