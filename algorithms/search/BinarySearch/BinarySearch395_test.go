Scenario 1: Query Item Exists at the Middle of the Array

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item exists exactly at the middle of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that exists exactly at the middle of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the return value of the function is the middle index of the array.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the binarySearch function correctly identifies the position of the query item in the array. This test is important because it checks the primary functionality of the binarySearch function.

Scenario 2: Query Item Exists at the Beginning of the Array

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item exists at the beginning of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that exists at the beginning of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the return value of the function is zero.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the binarySearch function correctly identifies the position of the query item in the array. This test is important because it checks the edge case where the query item exists at the beginning of the array.

Scenario 3: Query Item Exists at the End of the Array

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item exists at the end of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that exists at the end of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the return value of the function is equal to the length of the array minus one.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the binarySearch function correctly identifies the position of the query item in the array. This test is important because it checks the edge case where the query item exists at the end of the array.

Scenario 4: Query Item Does Not Exist in the Array

Details:
    Description: This test aims to verify the correct functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item does not exist in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: An array of integers sorted in ascending order and a query item that does not exist in the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the arranged array and query item.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to assert that the return value of the function is -1.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the binarySearch function correctly identifies that the query item does not exist in the array. This test is important because it checks the functionality of the binarySearch function when the query item is not found in the array.
