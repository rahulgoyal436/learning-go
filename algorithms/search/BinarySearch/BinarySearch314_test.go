Scenario 1: Query Item Exists at the Middle of the Array

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the binarySearch function correctly returns the index of the query item when it exists at the middle of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array of integers and a query integer that exists at the middle of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned index is the middle index of the array.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the binarySearch function when the query item exists at the middle of the array. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the ideal case where the query item is found at the first check.

Scenario 2: Query Item Exists at the End of the Array

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the binarySearch function correctly returns the index of the query item when it exists at the end of the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array of integers and a query integer that exists at the end of the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned index is the last index of the array.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the binarySearch function when the query item exists at the end of the array. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the item is found after multiple checks.

Scenario 3: Query Item Does Not Exist in the Array

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the binarySearch function correctly returns -1 when the query item does not exist in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array of integers and a query integer that does not exist in the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned value is -1.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the binarySearch function when the query item does not exist in the array. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the item is not found.

Scenario 4: Query Item Exists Multiple Times in the Array

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the binarySearch function correctly returns the first index of the query item when it exists multiple times in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array of integers and a query integer that exists multiple times in the array.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned index is the first occurrence of the query item in the array.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the binarySearch function when the query item exists multiple times in the array. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the item is found at the first occurrence.

Scenario 5: Array is Empty

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the binarySearch function correctly returns -1 when the array is empty.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an empty array and a query integer.
    Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the empty array and the query integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned value is -1.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the binarySearch function when the array is empty. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where there are no items to search from.
