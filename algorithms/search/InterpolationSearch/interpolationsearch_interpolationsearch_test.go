Below are several test scenarios designed for the `interpolationSearch` function described above. These scenarios cover different aspects of normal operation, edge cases, and potential error conditions that might arise when using the function. The package name, imports, and struct definitions were not specified, so they have not been included in these scenarios beyond their considerations in the execution description.

### Scenario 1: Successful Search - Element Present
```
Scenario 1: Successful Search - Element Present

Details:
    Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies the position of an element that is present in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and a query value 30.
    Act: Invoke the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns 2, the index of 30 in the array.
Validation:
    The assertion checks for the correct index of a known value. This test ensures that the function can find elements in the array, which is fundamental to its intended operation.
```

### Scenario 2: Element Not Present in the Array
```
Scenario 2: Element Not Present in the Array

Details:
    Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the queried element is not present in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and a query value 25.
    Act: Invoke the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns -1, indicating the element is not in the array.
Validation:
    The test asserts that the function correctly returns -1 for absent elements. This behavior is crucial for signaling that an element could not be found.
```

### Scenario 3: Empty Array
```
Scenario 3: Empty Array

Details:
    Description: Ensures the function behaves correctly when supplied an empty array as input.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty array [] and a query value 10.
    Act: Invoke the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Check the return value is -1.
Validation:
    A critical edge case. The function should return -1 when the array has no elements. This handles empty input gracefully and maintains robustness.
```

### Scenario 4: Array with One Element - Found
```
Scenario 4: Array with One Element - Found

Details:
    Description: Validates the function's capability to handle a single-element array where the element equals the query.
Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an array [10] and a query value 10.
    Act: Execute the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Verify the return value is 0, as 10 is at index 0.
Validation:
    Ensures correct functionality on minimal input, confirming it can correctly find an element when only one is present.
```

### Scenario 5: Array with One Element - Not Found
```
Scenario 5: Array with One Element - Not Found

Details:
    Description: Tests behavior with a single-element array where the element and the query differ.
Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an array [10] and a query value 20.
    Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Validate that -1 is returned.
Validation:
    Checks that the function appropriately returns -1 when a single-element array does not contain the query, confirming correct failure conditions.
```

### Scenario 6: High Value Greater than Array's Max
```
Scenario 6: High Value Greater than Array's Max

Details:
    Description: Tests function behavior when the query is greater than the largest item in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and a query value 60.
    Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Ensure the result is -1.
Validation:
    Confirms the function gracefully handles queries beyond the array's upper boundary by returning -1, preventing errors or false positives.
```

### Scenario 7: Low Value Less than Array's Min
```
Scenario 7: Low Value Less than Array's Min

Details:
    Description: Verifies function behavior when the query is less than the smallest element.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and a query value 5.
    Act: Execute the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Check that -1 is returned.
Validation:
    Tests the function's ability to handle queries below the smallest element value, maintaining the expected behavior and boundary management.
```

### Scenario 8: Duplicate Elements in the Array
```
Scenario 8: Duplicate Elements in the Array

Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns the index of a duplicate value in the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an array [10, 20, 20, 40, 50] and a query value 20.
    Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Verify the result is 1, the index of the first occurrence of 20.
Validation:
    Here, the function should prioritize finding the first occurrence in an array with duplicates, a common requirement in search implementations.
```

These scenarios provide comprehensive coverage of the `interpolationSearch` function's expected behavior under a variety of conditions. By addressing these scenarios, one can ensure confidence in the function's correct implementation and alignment with business requirements.
