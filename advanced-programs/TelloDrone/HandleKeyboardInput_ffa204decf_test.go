	// TODO: Add assertions here to verify the behavior of the function.
	// This will depend on the specific behavior of the drone and the keyboard event.
	// For example, if the drone is supposed to move left when the 'A' key is pressed, you could check the drone's position.
	// If the position is not as expected, call t.Error or t.Fail.

	// Repeat the above steps for other keys and expected behaviors.
